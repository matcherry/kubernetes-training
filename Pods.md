### `kubectl commands to check the cluster health`

[Kubectl using command to get cluster status](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54882727/kubectl-using-command-to-get-cluster-status#:~:text=To%20get%20detailed%20information%20to,componentstatus%20or%20kubectl%20get%20cs)

The below command would display the health of scheduler, controller andÂ `etcd`

The least expensive way to check if you can reach the API server isÂ `kubectl version.`In additionÂ `kubectl cluster-info`
Â gives you some more info. another one isÂ `kubectl get componentstatus`. `kubectl get componentstatus`
Â depricated

`kubectl get cs`Command below lists Kubernetes core components like,Â `etcd`, controller, scheduler, kube-proxy, core-dns, network plugin. All those pods should be running to be sure that Kubernetes is healthy. `kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

Finally deploy one front-end and back-end Pod and verify the inter-pod communication to ensure that cluster is up and working correctly.

Below are the commands to get cluster status based on requirements:

- To get information regarding where your Kubernetes master is running at, CoreDNS is running at, kubernetes-dasboard is running at, useÂ `kubectl cluster-info`
- To get detailed information to further debug and diagnose cluster problem, useÂ `kubectl cluster-info dump`
- To get only the health status for your node use,Â `kubectl get componentstatus`Â orÂ `kubectl get cs`
- To show detailed information about a resource useÂ `kubectl describe node <node>`

### `What are Pods`

[Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)

[https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/pod#:~:text=Pods are the smallest%2C most,and share the Pod's resources](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/pod#:~:text=Pods%20are%20the%20smallest%2C%20most,and%20share%20the%20Pod's%20resources)

***Pods***Â are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

AÂ *Pod*Â (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or moreÂ [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/), with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.

As well as application containers, a Pod can containÂ [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)Â that run during Pod startup. You can also injectÂ [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/)Â for debugging if your cluster offers this.

<aside>
ðŸ”® **Note:Â While Kubernetes supports moreÂ [container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes)Â than just Docker,Â [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)Â is the most commonly known runtime, and it helps to describe Pods using some terminology from Docker.**

</aside>

The shared context of a Pod is a set of Linux namespaces, cgroups, and potentially other facets of isolation - the same things that isolate a Docker container. Within a Pod's context, the individual applications may have further sub-isolations applied.

In terms of Docker concepts, a Pod is similar to a group of Docker containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.

Pods in a Kubernetes cluster are used in two main ways:

- **Pods that run a single container**. The "one-container-per-Pod" model is the most common Kubernetes use case; in this case, you can think of a Pod as a wrapper around a single container; Kubernetes manages Pods rather than managing the containers directly.
- **Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together**. A Pod can encapsulate an application composed of multiple co-located containers that are tightly coupled and need to share resources. These co-located containers form a single cohesive unit of serviceâ€”for example, one container serving data stored in a shared volume to the public, while a separateÂ *sidecar*Â container refreshes or updates those files. The Pod wraps these containers, storage resources, and an ephemeral network identity together as a single unit.

## Pod lifecycle

[Pod Lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)

Pods are ephemeral. They are not designed to run forever, and when a Pod is terminated it cannot be brought back. In general, Pods do not disappear until they are deleted by a user or by a controller.

Pods do not "heal" or repair themselves. For example, if a Pod is scheduled on a node which later fails, the Pod is deleted. Similarly, if a Pod is evicted from a node for any reason, the Pod does not replace itself.

Each Pod has aÂ `PodStatus`Â API object, which is represented by a Pod'sÂ `status`Â field. Pods publish theirÂ *phase*Â to theÂ `status: phase`Â field. The phase of a Pod is a high-level summary of the Pod in its current state.

When you runÂ `[kubectl get pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)`Â to inspect a Pod running on your cluster, a Pod can be in one of the following possible phases:

- **Pending:**Â Pod has been created and accepted by the cluster, but one or more of its containers are not yet running. This phase includes time spent being scheduled on a node and downloading images.
- **Running:**Â Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is running, is in the process of starting, or is restarting.
- **Succeeded:**Â All containers in the Pod have terminated successfully. Terminated Pods do not restart.
- **Failed:**Â All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. A container "fails" if it exits with a non-zero status.
- **Unknown:**Â The state of the Pod cannot be determined.

Additionally,Â `PodStatus`Â contains an array calledÂ `PodConditions`, which is represented in the Pod manifest asÂ `conditions`. The field has aÂ `type`Â andÂ `status`Â field.Â `conditions`Â indicates more specifically the conditions within the Pod that are causing its current status.

### `kubectl explain pod`

`Creating a Pod using the kubectl command
Getting a Pod
Describing a Pod
Writing a Pod Manifest(Spec)`

The Kubernetes scheduler automatically assigns pods to nodes, however there are times where you need more control over where the scheduler assigns pods. For example, you need to schedule a pod to a certain machine that has an SSD attached to it.

There are different ways to achive this, using:Â `nodeSelector`,Â `Affinity`Â andÂ `Anti-Affinity`, which all useÂ [Labels and Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/).

In this scenario, we'll be covering how to assign pods to nodes usingÂ `nodeSelector`. For further reading, check outÂ [Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/).

# **Init Container**

AnÂ [Init Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)Â is a container which is executed before the application container is started.Â `Init-containers`Â are usually used for deploying utilities or execute scripts which are not loaded and executed in the application container image.
